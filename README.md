# ThinkfulNewStart
<h1>Thinkful Tutorial on Front End Design</h1>
<h3>First Project - About me page</h3>
<p>During this lesson you will be coding an "About Me" website based on this example design . You will learn to use CodePen which will then be used to complete this project.</p>

<p>You will plan you page by creating a wireframe. From there you will build your "About Me" page for scratch using HTML and CSS skills. You'll create the page section by section during the lesson. Try not look at the finished code until the end.</p>

<p>You might occasionally experience frustration during this lesson, but stick with it. Solving problems you encounter will help you internalize your new coding skills. And just remember, by the end of the lesson, you will have created your own "About Me" page from scratch.</p>

<h3>Secon Project - Karma Landing Page</h3>
<p>For this project, you will clone the landing page of a startup called Karma. Since Karma is a live startup that regularly updates their site, the link above will send you to a previous version of Karma's site.</p>

<p>You will begin this lesson by updating Sublime text, which will then be used to build your Karma clone. To save your work you will be using GitHub, so you will also be initializing a new repository before starting to build your Karma clone.</p>

<p>During the build you will be given a number of challenges, in which you will attempt to re-create sections of the Karma landing page using HTML and CSS before checking your work in a skill walkthrough. Along the way you'll use the Chrome Developer Tools to debug your own code and 'inspect' what others are doing with their code - just like you did with the New York Times project.</p>

<p>This lesson will cover a few key techniques and will point you to tips and resources to help you work through this project. You will also learn some new techniques and finishing touches, including how to incorporate FavIcons.</p>
